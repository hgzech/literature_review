Dysfunctions of serotonin system activity have also been implicated in a number of psychiatric conditions, particularly https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2020.107985 Received 3 September 2019; Received in revised form 29 January 2020; Accepted 31 January 2020 mood disorders and anxiety (Carr and Lucki, 2010;Deakin and Graeff, 1991;Graeff et al., 1996;Guimar\u00e3es et al., 2010). Notably, serotonergic interventions particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are also the front-line treatment for depression and anxiety (Jones and Blackburn, 2002). Anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of SSRIs appear to involve long-term adaptations in the serotonin system following extended treatment (Bielski et al., 2004). However, short term side effects include exacerbation of negative emotional symptoms and \"jitteriness\", anxiety, nervousness, restlessness, agitation and irritability (Gorman et al., 1987;Grillon et al., 2007;Ramos et al., 1993). This deleterious acute response to SSRIs may contribute to inefficacy of treatment or cause worsening of psychiatric symptoms. However, relatively little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying the acute anxiogenic effect produced by SSRIs.\nAcute SSRI administration enhances extracellular serotonin levels throughout the brain resulting from inhibition of the serotonin transporter (SERT). The majority of serotonin neurons innervating the forebrain originate in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) or median raphe nucleus (MRN) (Azmitia and Segal, 1978;Vertes, 1991;Vertes et al., 1999). These two main projection systems differ in a number of ways including innervation patterns, neuronal morphology, presumed mode of neurotransmission, and perhaps behavioural functions (Vertes andLinley, 2008, 2007). Both the DRN and MRN systems have been implicated in the expression of anxiety-like behaviours. Cell-type specific optogenetic manipulation of 5-HT cells in the MRN produce anxiogenic behaviour in male and female mice (Ohmura et al., 2014). Indeed, Fig. 1.

The fact that such effects could be obtained with relatively selective manipulations such as 5-HT-depleting lesions (Andrade and Graeff, 2001), or intracranial infusions of 5-HT selective drugs (Carli et al., 1989;Vicente et al., 2008) supports a specific role for MRN serotonergic neurons in mediating these effects. Andrade et al. (2013) further suggest that serotonergic efferents from the MRN to the dorsal hippocampus (dHC) are especially important for modulating anxiety based on evidence from studies involving simultaneous microinjections of 5-HTacting drugs into both sites (Dos Santos et al., 2008). It was recently demonstrated that selective stimulation of 5-HT terminals in the ventral hippocampus reproduce the anxiogenic effect caused by stimulation of 5-HT cells in the MRN (Ohmura et al., 2019). Despite greater prevalence of anxiety disorders in women (Pigott, 1999), preclinical studies of anxiety-like behaviour in male mice outnumber those using females. Therefore, in the current research we used female mice to investigate the contribution of 5-HT inputs to the dHC to the modulation of anxiety. However, it should be noted that our goal was not to study sex differences in 5-HT modulation of anxiety but to investigate the serotonergic modulation of the dHC while working towards correcting the imbalance in preclinical neuroscience research (Shansky, 2019;Will et al., 2017).\nTechniques such as optogenetics provide a way to selectively manipulate neuronal activity in discrete cell populations. Recently, we used this approach to examine the effects of stimulating 5-HT neurons of the DRN on reward-related behaviours (Browne et al., 2019). This involved expressing ChR2 in 5-HT neurons, by crossing mice from the Ai32 conditional ChR2 reporter line with ePet-cre mice that express Cre recombinase driven by the enhancer region of the Pet-1 gene (Scott and Deneris, 2005). As part of this work we showed that stimulation of the DRN activated 5-HT cells leading to enhanced 5-HT release in terminal regions. In the present study we have applied this method to investigate the role of serotonergic efferents from the MRN and serotonergic terminals in the dHC in the expression of anxiety-related behaviours in female mice. We found that stimulation of 5-HT neurons in the MRN increased the expression of anxiety-like behaviours, as measured in several tests of anxiety: exploration on the elevated plus maze, noveltysuppressed feeding and marble-burying. We also confirmed that optogenetic stimulation of the MRN increased 5-HT neuronal activity, and increased release of 5-HT in the dHC. Stimulation of 5-HT terminals in the dHC recapitulated some of these behaviours. These results show that 5-HT output from the MRN rapidly modulates the expression of anxiety-like behaviour, in part via its interaction with the dHC.", "n_publication_ref": 31, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "Materials and methods", "text": "", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Animals", "text": "Adult (10+ weeks old) female mice were used in these experiments.

Using an optogenetic approach, we show that stimulating MRN 5-HT neurons causes an anxiogenic response in mice using three tests of anxiety: the novelty-suppressed feeding test, marble burying, and elevated-plus maze. Furthermore, we show that some of these behavioral responses are also observed following selective stiof 5-HT terminals in the dHC. However, photostimulation of either the MRN or 5-HT input to the dHC did not cause a real-time place aversion, suggesting that the effects observed in the tests of anxiety are not due to an inherently aversive property of optogenetic stimulation. These observations support a specific role for 5-HT neurons originating in the MRN-and their projection to the dHC-in the expression of anxiety-like behaviour.\nThe present finding that MRN stimulation is anxiogenic under various test conditions is consistent with previous work using a variety of surgical, pharmacological and genetic approaches (for review, see Andrade et al., 2013). Lesions of the MRN in rats tend to reduce the expression of anxiety-like behaviour; these effects have been observed with both electrolytic (Andrade and Graeff, 2001;et al., 1998) and serotonin-selective neurotoxic lesions (Silva et al., 2002(Silva et al., , 2004and Graeff, 2001). It should be noted, however, that in some cases selective lesions of 5-HT neurons in the MRN had no effect on anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated-plus maze (Netto et al., 2002;et al., 2000) or in a test of social interaction (File et al., 1979), which may be due to compensation in other circuits that receive 5-HT input such as the periaqueductal gray or the amygdala, which also support the expression of anxiety. Consistent with the anxiogenic effects of MRN lesions, temporary inactivation of the MRN using 5-HT 1A agonists increases avoidance of several naturally aversive test stimuli, including the open arms in the elevated-plus maze , conspecifics in tests of social interaction (Andrews et al., 1994), and the illuminated chamber in the light/dark test (Carli and Samanin, 1988). Activation of MRN neurons, using electrical stimulation or specific pharmacological activation of 5-HT neurons, promote anxietylike behaviour (Graeff and Silveira Filho, 1978;. These effects are comparable to those reported here using an optogenetic approach chosen for its selectivity for 5-HT neurons. Many of effects involving manipulation of neuronal activity of the MRN have also been shown to be similar between male and female subjects (Andrade et al., 2009(Andrade et al., , 2005De Almeida and Lucion, 1997). Further, our findings replicate a recent demonstration that optogenetic manipulation of 5-HT output from the MRN enhances anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated-plus maze in both male and female mice (Ohmura et al., 2019(Ohmura et al., , 2014. We extend these latter findings to show that this anxiogenic-like effect occurs in other test situations including marble-burying and feeding in a novel environment. The results of a number of control tests rule out the possibility that these effects are mediated by generalized disruptions in locomotor activity, feeding behaviour or stimulation-induced aversion. Collectively, all of this work demonstrates an important role for MRN 5-HT neurons in the modulation of anxietylike behaviour.\nThe MRN and DRN both provide strong serotonergic innervation of the forebrain, including to a number of limbic structures implicated in the regulation of anxiety such as the hippocampus, and septum (Vertes, 1991;. Despite these similarities, the MRN and DRN give rise to overlapping yet distinct neural circuits that differ in terms of their projection patterns, neuronal morphology, neurotransmission dynamics, and potentially the behavioral functions supported by each (for review, see Calizo et al., 2011). For example, while the dorsal periaqueductal gray area receives innervation primarily from the DRN, the dHC receives mostly 5-HT input from the MRN (Vertes, 1991;Vertes et al., 1999). Given these differences, the MRN and DRN may interact with these structures in a circuit-specific manner to modulate anxiety, though the mechanics underlying this circuitry have not been thoroughly characterized. In one study, Dos  demonstrated that microinjection of a 5-HT antagonist into the MRN, to increase 5-HT activity, facilitated acquisition of inhibitory avoidance, -an effect that was blocked by pre-administration of the same 5-HT antagonist in the dHC (Dos . Based on this finding, it has been postulated that 5-HT input to the dHC arising from the MRN plays an important role in the regulation of anxiety (Andrade et al., 2013), though until now this hypothesis has not been directly addressed. Using an optogenetic approach that is anatomically and cellspecific, we show that activation of 5-HT terminals in the dHC induced anxiogenic behavioural responses. This effect closely mirrored the effect of MRN stimulation, indicating that the projection of 5-HT neurons from the MRN to the dHC is important for regulating the expression of anxiety-like behaviour.\nStimulation of the dHC produced an anxiogenic response in the novelty-suppressed feeding and marble burying tests, but not in the elevated-plus maze. The expression of anxiety is a complex behavioural process, supported by an elaborate set of circuits throughout the brain. In addition the interaction we have shown here between the MRN and the dHC, the MRN projects to several other brain regions that contribute to the regulation of anxiety (Vertes et al., 1999), including the amygdala complex (Tye et al., 2011). Furthermore, although the MRN is the predominant source of 5-HT input in the dHC (Vertes et al., 1999), the dHC also receives some 5-HT input from the DRN. Given that pharmacological manipulations of 5-HT function in the DRN alter anbehaviour (File et al., 1979;; but see Ohmura et al., 2014), the interaction of the DRN with the dHC may also contribute to the regulation of anxiety-like behaviour. Future studies should delineate the specific contribution of 5-HT terminals in structures other than the dHC, in the regulation of anxiety.\nThe results of the current study demonstrate the importance of 5-HT input to the dHC in the regulation of anxiety. Based on these results, the functional interaction occurring between 5-HT input to the dHC seems to involve the control of behaviour in contexts that involve a conflict between approach and avoidance. This was observed in a variety of behavioural paradigms, including novelty-suppressed feeding and marble burying. For many years, the interaction between 5-HT system and the hippocampus has been characterized as part of a broader behavioural inhibition system (Gray, 1982). Under this system, anxiety is presumed to be a result of inhibition of ongoing behaviour in response to detection of innately fear-provoking stimuli (e.g., open spaces). Further, the hippocampus may act as a comparator between expected and actual environmental stimuli (Gray, 1987), which would activate the behavioural inhibition system the two are mismatched (e.g. in the presence of an approach-avoidance conflict). The results of the current study provide strong evidence for the role of 5-HT input to the hippocampus as part of the behavioural inhibition system, especially as pertains to the control of ongoing behaviour in innately contexts. In conclusion, these studies show that 5-HT neurons originating in the MRN, and their interaction with the dHC, contribute to the expression anxiety. This interaction represents one possible mediator of the effects produced by short-term SSRI treatment. Future work should examine the effect of chronic upregulation of activity in this circuit to determine if context associations formed during testing, and their associated expressions of anxiety, are potentiated across time. Furthermore, the specific receptor mechanisms underlying the interaction between 5-HT terminals and the dHC is unknown. Future studies should delineate the specific contribution of 5-HT receptor subtypes in the dHC, such as 5-HT 1A , underlying the regulation of anxiety. Closer examination of the receptor mechanisms underlying the interactions between the serotonergic system interacts and other circuits will shed light on the etiology of anxiety and help refine treatment strategies.", "n_publication_ref": 29, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Declaration of competing interest", "text": "The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}], "references": [{"title": "Effect of estradiol benzoate microinjection into the median raphe nucleus on contextual conditioning", "journal": "Behav.
