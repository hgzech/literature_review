    "Lastly, we estimated the reliability of the current AAT. For this purpose, we used the bootstrapped split-half reliability functionality available in the AATtools package (Kahveci, 2019) for R (R Core Team, 2019). First, we performed 1000 random splits on the data. In each split, we excluded outlying trials and errors as we described in the methods section. Unlike in the Methods section, however, we did not exclude entire participants’ sessions if they had excessive error/outlier rates; if we did, the halved size of the samples would lead to the exclusion of a high number of participants. Next, we computed an approach bias score for each half of each split by subtracting the mean reaching time difference of approach-object and avoid-object trials from the mean reaching time difference between approach-food and avoid-food trials. We excluded participants in each half that had an approach bias score deviating more than 3 SD from the sample mean. We then computed the correlation between the two resulting approach bias scores for each participant. After obtaining 1000 such correlations, we computed the mean correlation coefficient and applied a Spearman-Brown correction to account for the halved test length, thereby obtaining a split-half reliability value that is not biased due to the arbitrariness of a single split, or due to outliers that disproportionately affect the correlation.\n",
    "<b>The split-half reliability of the full dataset (2 sessions per participant) was acceptable, (rSB = .58). When sessions were analyzed separately, reliability was lower (food-deprived rSB = .48, satiated rSB = .49). The test-retest reliability between food-deprived and satiated sessions was low (rretest = .23).</b>\n",
    "Using the same methodology as described above, we additionally computed the bootstrapped split-half reliability for raw pull and push reaction times for foods and objects, as well as reliabilities for push-pull difference scores for foods and objects separately. The reliabilities for single conditions were close to 1 (pull food: rSB = .98; push food: rSB = .99; pull objects: rSB = .97; push objects: rSB = .99) and the reliabilities for push-pull difference scores were also very high (push food – pull food: rSB = .95; push object – pull object: rSB = .89)."
